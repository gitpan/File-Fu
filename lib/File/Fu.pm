=head1 NAME

File::Fu - file and directory objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The directory constructor:

  use File::Fu;

  my $dir = File::Fu->dir("bar");
  print "$dir\n"; # 'bar/'

  my $file = $dir + 'bar.txt';
  print "$file\n"; # 'bar/bar.txt'

  my $d2 = $dir % 'baz'; # 'barbaz/'
  my $d3 = $dir / 'bat'; # 'bar/bat/'

  my $file2 = $dir / 'bat' + 'foo.txt'; # 'bar/bat/foo.txt'

The file constructor:

  my $file = File::Fu->file("foo");
  $file->e and warn "$file exists";
  $file->l and warn "$file is a link";
  warn "file is in ", $file->dir;

=head1 ABOUT

This class provides the toplevel interface to File::Fu directory and
file objects, with operator overloading which allows precise path
composition and support for most builtin methods, as well as creation of
temporary files/directories, finding files, and more.

The interface and style are quite different than the perl builtins or
File::Spec.  The syntax is concise.  Errors are thrown with croak(), so
you never need to check a return code.

=cut

use Cwd ();

use File::Fu::File;
use File::Fu::Dir;
use File::Spec ();

use constant dir_class => 'File::Fu::Dir';
use constant file_class => 'File::Fu::File';

=head1 Constructors

The actual objects are in the 'Dir' and 'File' sub-namespaces.

=head2 dir

  my $dir = File::Fu->dir($path);

See L<File::Fu::Dir/new>

=cut

sub dir {
  my $package = shift;

  $package or croak("huh?");
  # also as a function call
  unless($package and $package->isa(__PACKAGE__)) {
    unshift(@_, $package);
    $package = __PACKAGE__;
  }

  $package->dir_class->new(@_);
} # end subroutine dir definition

=head2 file

  my $file = File::Fu->file($path);

See L<File::Fu::File/new>

=cut

sub file {
  my $package = shift;

  # also as a function call
  unless($package->isa(__PACKAGE__)) {
    unshift(@_, $package);
    $package = __PACKAGE__;
  }

  $package->file_class->new(@_);
} # end subroutine file definition

=head1 Class Constants

=head2 tmp

Your system's '/tmp/' directory (or equivalent of that.)

  my $dir = File::Fu->tmp;

=cut

{
my $tmp; # XXX needs locking?
sub tmp {
  my $package = shift;
  $tmp and return($tmp);
  return($tmp = $package->dir(File::Spec->tmpdir));
}}
########################################################################

=head2 home

User's $HOME directory.

  my $dir = File::Fu->home;

=cut

{
my $home; # XXX needs locking!
sub home {
  my $package = shift;
  $home and return($home);
  return($home = $package->dir($ENV{HOME}));
}} # end subroutine home definition
########################################################################

=head2 program_name

The absolute name of your program.  This will be relative from the time
File::Fu was loaded.  It dies if the name is '-e'.

  my $prog = File::Fu->program_name;

If File::Fu was loaded after a chdir and the $0 was relative, calling
program_name() throws an error.  (Unless you set $0 correctly before
requiring File::Fu.)

=head2 program_dir

Returns what typically corresponds to program_name()->dirname, but
just the compile-time cwd() when $0 is -e/-E.

  my $dir = File::Fu->program_dir;

=cut

{
# fun startup stuff and various logic:
my $prog = $0;
my $name_sub;
my $dir_sub;
if(lc($prog) eq '-e') {
  my $prog_dir = Cwd::cwd();
  $dir_sub  = eval(qq(sub {shift->dir("$prog_dir")}));
  $name_sub = eval(qq(sub {croak("program_name => '$prog'")}));
}
else {
  if(-e $prog) {
    my $prog_name = __PACKAGE__->file($prog)->absolutely;
    my $prog_dir = $prog_name->dirname;
    $name_sub = eval(qq(sub {shift->file('$prog_name')}));
    $dir_sub  = eval(qq(sub {shift->dir('$prog_dir')}));
  }
  else {
    # runtime error
    $dir_sub  = sub {croak("$prog not found => no program_dir known")};
    $name_sub = sub {croak("$prog not found => no program_name known")};
  }
}
*program_name = $name_sub;
*program_dir  = $dir_sub;
} # program_name/program_dir

=head1 Class Methods

=head2 THIS_FILE

A nicer way to say __FILE__.

  my $file = File::Fu->THIS_FILE;

=cut

sub THIS_FILE {
  my $package = shift;
  my $name = (caller)[1];
  return $package->file($name);
} # end subroutine THIS_FILE definition
########################################################################

=head2 cwd

The current working directory.

  my $dir = File::Fu->cwd;

=cut

sub cwd {
  my $package = shift;

  defined(my $ans = Cwd::cwd()) or croak("cwd() failed");
  return $package->dir($ans);
} # end subroutine cwd definition
########################################################################

=head2 which

Returns File::Fu::File objects of ordered candidates for $name found in
the path.

  my @prog = File::Fu->which($name) or die "cannot find $name";

If called in scalar context, returns a single File::Fu::File object or throws an error if no candidates were found.

  my $prog = File::Fu->which($name);

=cut

sub which {
  my $package = shift;
  croak("must have an argument") unless(@_);
  my ($what) = @_;

  require File::Which;
  if(wantarray) {
    return map({$package->file($_)} File::Which::which($what));
  }
  else {
    my $found = scalar(File::Which::which($what)) or
      croak("cannot locate '$what' in PATH");
    return $package->file($found);
  }
} # which ##############################################################

=head1 Temporary Directories and Files

These class methods call the corresponding File::Fu::Dir methods on the
value of tmp().  That is, you get a temporary file/dir in the '/tmp/'
directory.

=head2 temp_dir

  my $dir = File::Fu->temp_dir;

=cut

sub temp_dir {
  my $package = shift;
  $package->tmp->temp_dir(@_);
} # end subroutine temp_dir definition
########################################################################

=head2 temp_file

  my $handle = File::Fu->temp_file;

=cut

sub temp_file {
  my $package = shift;
  $package->tmp->temp_file(@_);
} # end subroutine temp_file definition
########################################################################

=head1 Subclassing

You may wish to subclass File:Fu and override the dir_class() and/or
file_class() class methods to point to your own Dir/File subclasses.

  my $class = 'My::FileFu';
  my $dir = $class->dir("foo");

See L<File::Fu::File> and L<File::Fu::Dir> for more info.
